# 🥁 PocketDrumMachine

**PocketDrumMachine** is an electronics project aimed at creating a hardware instrument inspired by the **Pocket Operator** from Teenage Engineering. This project uses a **Raspberry Pi Pico** and is developed with **PlatformIO**. The goal is to build a portable drum machine with 8-bit sounds and sound effects, while exploring the creation of a dedicated OS.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: Microcontroller to manage the instrument
- **PlatformIO**: Development environment
- **OLED Screen SSD1306**: For display
- **NumPad**: For user interaction

## 🚀 Upcoming Features
- 8-bit sounds: kick, snare, hihats, bass
- Sound effects: Reverb, Echo, Chorus, Filter
- User interface: Developing a simple OS for the instrument

## 🛠️ Roadmap

- [x] **Basic Components** (LEDs, Buttons)
- [x] **Screen Component** (OLED Screen SSD1306)
- [x] **NumPad Component**
- [ ] **Play Music** (waiting for necessary hardware)
- [ ] **Music Development** (design various 8-bit sounds: kick, snare, hihats, bass)
- [ ] **Release V0.1**
- [ ] **OS Development** (UI, sounds)
- [ ] **Sound Effects** (Reverb, Echo, Chorus, Filter)
- [ ] **Create V1 of the Hardware**
- [ ] **Release V1**

## 🎯 Goal
To create a portable music instrument with full functionality, enabling users to play and experiment with 8-bit sounds and various sound effects.
